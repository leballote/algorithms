This week I've been doing algorithms

On Monday I finished the remaining part of the first course, and started algorithms.
On Thursday I made my presentation.
And the other days I've been working on algorithms' exercises.

Currently I am at exercise 22 (Fishes of varying sizes, I just started it).

I can finish up 24, but I skiped 15 (search in 2D matrix with sorted cols and sorted rows); I tried so hard that problem and found a couple of clever solutions, but I read that there is an O(m + n), and I couldn't find it. I'll come back later to this problem.
